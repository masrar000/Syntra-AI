Creative professionals also show strong engagement, with a good click-through rate despite a slightly lower open rate. Ops managers, on the other hand, have a lower overall engagement, with a lower open rate and click-through rate. However, all segments have low unsubscribe rates, indicating that the content is resonating well with the audience. \n\nTo capitalize on the high engagement of startup founders, it may be beneficial to tailor future campaigns specifically towards this segment, highlighting the benefits of AI in creative automation for startups. For ops managers, it could be helpful to A/B test different messaging or content to see what resonates best with this audience and improve engagement. Additionally, for all segments, it may be beneficial to conduct a survey or feedback session to gather insights on what type of content or information they are most interested in receiving related to AI in creative automation.",
